Another early morning  
People are sleeping in dreamland  
I once again insomnia  
And see you online  
Suddenly the silence to break  
You call me on the phone  
These are two long-lost friends  
Indeed for quiet a while   
In the sound of familiar  
Time is passes quietly  
There is a tacit understanding between us  
I was moved and warm  
Do you really wonder  
We can soar the sky  
It‘s written a few years ago  
In the book of life  
You are the one  
Destined me to be encountered  
You are the one  
The one I'm always looking for  
For so long  
The one who keeps me going  
When I can't go on  
Oh，yeah……
